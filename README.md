# CipherForm Advanced Encryption Standard
**AES (Advanced Encryption Standard; also Rijndael) is a symmetric block encryption algorithm (block size 128 bits, key 128/192/256 bits) adopted as an encryption standard by the US government based on the results of the AES competition. This algorithm is well analyzed and is now widely used, as was the case with its predecessor DES.**
